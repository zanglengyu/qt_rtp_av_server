MAST_LISTEN(1)

NAME
----
mast_listen - receive RTP multicast audio streams

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mast_listen' [-m timeout] [-o] [-f filename]
	[-p payload] [-s ssrc] <multicast group>/<port>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
mast_listen(1) is an RTP audio client. Unless another output option is selected
it plays the audio stream out your default sound output device using SDL. If 
SDL is not installed on your system, you must select a different output option.

mast_listen will start playing audio from the first source it receives a packet
from. If there is more than one transmitter in the multicast group, then the 
one you start listening to will be random. Use the '-s' option to select a source.

There isn't current any packet loss recovery or packet reordering support. This means
that the audio buffer will empty with each packet lost, and eventually need to re-buffer.


OPTIONS
-------
-h::
	Return usage and version information.

-m::
	Specifies the 'timeout' in seconds for waiting for a packet. If no packet
	is received in this time then mast_listen(1) aborts. Set to 0 to disable 
	timeout. Default is 10 seconds.

-o::
	Output the received audio to 'STDOUT'. The number of channels and the sample
	rate will depend on the payload type received but the sample format is
	always 16-bit two's complement.
		
-f::
	Save received audio to audio file 'filename'. Format of the file depends on
	the suffix of the filename, but will default to AIFF. Audio is not compressed,
	so recording for long periods will result in large files. 
	
-p::
	Only accept RTP packets of specified 'payload type'. Other packets of different
	payload types will be ignored. This is useful with '-o' to ensure that only 
	the expected audio format is written to STDOUT.

-s::
	Only accept RTP packets from specified hexadecial 'SSRC'. By default mast_listen will start
	playing audio from the first SSRC it receives on that multicast group. This option
	allows you to choose the source you want to receive from. 


EXAMPLES
--------

`mast_listen FF03::123/5010`

Listen to a stream on multicast on multicast group FF02::123 on port 5010

`mast_listen -f recording.wav FF03::123/5010`

Record stream to WAV audio file.


BUGS
----
- No packet loss compensation / packet re-ordering
