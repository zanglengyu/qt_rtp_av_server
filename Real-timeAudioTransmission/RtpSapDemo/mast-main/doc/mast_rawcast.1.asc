MAST_RAWCAST(1)

NAME
----
mast_rawcast - Directly broadcast a previously encoded audio file

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mast_rawcast' [options] <address>[/<port>] <filename>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
mast_rawcast(1) reads previously encoded audio from a file and then sends it out 
encapsulated in an RTP packet. The format of the data must be specified using 
the payload type option.

This tool only really makes sense for frame based encoded formats, and as such
only MPEG Audio and GSM are currently supported.

The address can either be a unicast, multicast, IPv4 or IPv6 address.

The port number should be an even number (RTCP reports are sent one port higher).
If no port number is specified, then the default RTP port number (5004) is used.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
	Return usage and version information.

-t::
	Sets 'TTL' (Time To Live) for packets sent. Packets will ignored after
	they have passed this number of routers. Default is 5, maximum is 127.

-p <payload>::
	'Payload type' of the packets. mast_rawcast currently only supports
	the following four static payload types:
	- 'MPA'
	- 'GSM'
		
-z <size>::
	'Maximum Payload size' of the packets. Allows you to choose the length of the payload
	data (in bytes) for each packet transmitted. This is usually a number between
	300 bytes and 1450 bytes. The actual packet size will be determined by the number of 
	blocks of 160 samples of audio that can be stored in the packet's payload.
	The maximum transmission unit (MTU) is determined by your networking equipment.
	Also be careful of IP-in-IP tunnelling as packets will have two IP headers which
	makes it more likely that the packet will be too big and get fragmented.
	
-s <ssrc>::
	By default a random SSRC is generated, however if you want to ensure that an SSRC
	remain constant between invocations of the program, then you may specify it here as 
	a hexadecimal number.
	
-d <dscp>::
	The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value specifies a packet's
	Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) along its path to its destination. It is a Quality of 
	Service (QoS) technique that can be used to provide better than best effort 
	packet delivery. The default PHB is Best Effort. Valid arguments are:
	- 'BE'  Best Effort
	- 'EF'  Expedited Forarding
	- 'AF11' to 'AF43'	Assured Forwarding
	- 'CS0' to 'CS7'  Classes 0 to 7
	
-l::
	'Loop' the audio file. Repeat playing the audio file when the end is reached.
	
	
EXAMPLES
--------

`mast_rawcast -p MPA -l 233.122.222.1 mpegaudio.mp2`

Repeatedly send an MPEG Audio file to the multicast group 233.122.222.1, port 5004.
The pre-compressed MPEG Audio data will be sent out using payload type 14.


`mast_rawcast -p GSM 152.78.64.103/4000 gsmaudio.gsm`

Read in an GSM audio file, and sent it to the unicast address 152.78.64.103, port 4000.
