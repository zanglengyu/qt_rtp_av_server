NAME
----
mast_rawrecord - Record/archive raw streams directly to disk

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mast_rawrecord' <address>[/<port>] <filename>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
mast_record(1) recieves data from an RTP stream and writes the payload 
straight to disk. This works well for binary bitstreams, such as MPEG Audio 
and GSM. It can also be used to dump continous audio streams to disk, for later
processessing by a tool such as sox(1).

The port number should be an even number (RTCP reports are sent one port higher).
If no port number is specified, then the default RTP port number (5004) is used.
