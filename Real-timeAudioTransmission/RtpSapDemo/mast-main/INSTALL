Installation of MAST
====================
Nicholas J. Humfrey <njh@aelius.com>

MAST uses autoconf/automake, so should work on most POSIX systems.


Quick Start
-----------

 ./configure
 make


Then as root:

 make install


Requirements
------------

MAST requires a very recent version of oRTP currently only available in CVS.
There is a tarball of this on the MAST website for convenience.


Most of the requirments are optional,
configure will add features depending on the
libraries available on your system.

mast_cast requires Jack for audio capture.

mast_record and mast_filecast require libsndfile.

The MPEG Audio codec requires TwoLAME.
